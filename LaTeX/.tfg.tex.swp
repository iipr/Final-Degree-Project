\begin{abstract}
	This work is about three different proofs of the same fact and a computational comparison between them, looking for the best one.

	Let $R$ be a real closed field and $n\geq 2$. We prove that: (1) for every finite subset $F$ of $R^n$,
	the semialgebraic set $R^n\setminus F$ is a polynomial image of $R^n$; and (2) for any
	independent linear forms $l_1,\ldots,l_r$ of $R^n$, the semialgebraic set
	$\{l_1>0,\ldots,l_r>0\}\subset R^n$ is a polynomial image of $R^n$.
	
	The key proof here is that $Q = \{x > 0, y > 0\}$ is a polynomial image of $\R^2$. This assert is proved in three different ways: a first approach using real algebraic geometry; a second and shorter one, using the composition of 3 rather simple maps; and a third one that applies topology with no computer computations.

\begin{section}{Introduction}
	\begin{definition}\label{polyMap}
	Let $R$ be a real closed field (see definition \ref{realCField}) and $m, n \in \N_{>0}$. A map $f = (f_1, \dots, f_n): R^m \longrightarrow R^n$ is said to be polynomial if $f_i \in R[x_1, \dots, x_m], i = 1,\dots, n$. 
	\end{definition}
	
	A very famous theorem by Tarski and Seidenberg states:
	\begin{theorem}[Tarski-Seidenberg]\label{tarskiSeidenberg}
	The image of any polynomial map $f: R^m \longrightarrow R^n$ is a semialgebraic subset (see definition \ref{semialgSet}) of $R^n$.
	\end{theorem}
	
	In this work we are studying sort of a converse of this statement. In an \emph{Oberwolfach} week, J.M. Gamboa proposed to characterize the semialgebraic subsets of $R^n$ that are polynomial images of $R^m$.

	\begin{notation}
	We need to mention to which topology we refer when we talk about closures, boundaries, etc. More specifically, the \textbf{exterior boundary} of a set $S$ is $\delta S := \bar{S} \backslash S$, with $\bar{S}$ being the \textbf{closure} of $S$ in $R^n$ in the usual topology. $\bar{S}^{\text{zar}}$ is the closure of $S$ with respect to the Zariski topology (see definition \ref{zariski}). $A\subset R^n$ is \textbf{irreducible} if its Zariski closure $\bar{A}^{\text{zar}}$ is an irreducible algebraic set.
	\end{notation}
	
	\begin{subsection}{Neccesary conditions and examples}
	To begin working on this idea, we provide some neccesary conditions for a set $S\subset R^n$ to be polynomial image of $R^m$. 
	
	It is trivial that for $m = n = 1$ (so $f: R \rightarrow R$), the images of polynomial maps are either a set of one point or singletons (if the map is constant), or unbounded closed intervals (think of $f(x) = x^2$), or the whole $R$ (think of $f(x) = x$).
	
	In the general case, by theorem \ref{tarskiSeidenberg}, .

\begin{chapter}{Auxiliar definitions and results}

\begin{definition}\label{realCField}
A \textbf{real closed field} is a field $R$ that has the $1\textsuperscript{st}$ order properties as the field of real numbers $\R$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{semialgSet}
A \textbf{semialgebraic set} is a subset $S \subset R^n$ (for some real closed field $R$) defined by a finite sequence of polynomial equations of the form:
\begin{align*}
	P_1(x_1, \dots&, x_n) = 0\\
	\vdots &\\
	P_r(x_1, \dots&, x_n) = 0 \\
	Q_1(x_1, \dots&, x_n) > 0 \\
	\vdots &\\
	Q_l(x_1, \dots&, x_n) > 0 \\
\end{align*}
. A \textbf{semialgebraic map} is a map that has semialgebraic graph. Moreover, the finite union, intersection and complement of semialgebraic sets is still a semialgebraic set.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Zariski topology]\label{zariski}
It is a topology on algebraic varieties whose closed sets are the algebraic subsets of the variety. Its sets are defined as the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations over a field $R$. In this topology, when we talk about the irreducibility of a element, we mean that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed under the Zariski topology.
